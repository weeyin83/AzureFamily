# #AzureFamily

I am a huge advocate of the IT community and regularly support user groups, conferences and people within that community regularly.  I founded the [Glasgow Azure User Group](https://www.gaug.co.uk) back in 2017 and the community has grown massively since then. 

[Gregor Suttie](https://www.gregorsuttie.co.uk) coined the hashtag *#AzureFamily* to try and join the dots on Twitter for people sharing information about Azure exams and help build the community.  The SQL/Data community have a very similar hashtag. 

When I started the Glasgow Azure User Group the only other Azure user group I could find in the UK was down in London, so having formed the second Azure user group in the UK is a nice achievement to have.  Since then there has been an explosion of user groups in the UK and to try and collate that and bring the community together I have created a map of the ones that I am aware of.  There is a UK map and an European map is in the throws of being formed. 

The maps can be found at [https://aka.ms/AzureFamily](https://aka.ms/AzureFamily)

I've created some graphics that can be used in your email signature to help spread the work about the community. Please feel free to take a copy and spread the word!
